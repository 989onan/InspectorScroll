# InspectorScroll

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows scrolling inspectors (and other ui panels) using your thumbstick / touchpad.<br>

Tested to work on Oculus Quest 2 controllers.

This is a workaround for [#149](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/149)

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [InspectorScroll.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/InspectorScroll/releases/latest/download/InspectorScroll.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
